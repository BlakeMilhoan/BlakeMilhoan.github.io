    <title>Dr. Pepper Review</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Dr. pepper is my #1 favorite drink, and has been for the past couple of years. However, if you asked me to try and describe the taste of it to anyone, I wouldn't be able to. This is because Dr. Pepper just tastes like Dr. Pepper, there's no other taste like it. That is why it's my favorite, it's one of the few drinks that has a unique taste that I actually like.</p>
